#Prog13: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the difference of the two numbers.
 
#Asks the user for the two numbers and directly converts it into an integer
n1 = int(input("Give me some numbers, first one = "))
n2 = int(input("second one = "))

#The program that computes the difference of the two numbers given and prints it
difference = n1 - n2
print(f"The difference of the two numbers is {difference}")
