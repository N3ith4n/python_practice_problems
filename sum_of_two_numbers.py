#Prog03: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the sum of the two numbers.
 
#Asks the user for the two numbers and directly converts it into an integer
n1 = int(input("Give me some numbers, first one = "))
n2 = int(input("second one = "))

#The program adds the two numbers and prints it
sum =  n1 + n2
print(f"The sum of the two numbers is {sum}")
