#Prog15: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the remainder when the first number is divided by the second number.
 
#Asks the user for the two numbers and directly converts it into an integer
n1 = int(input("Give me some numbers, first one = "))
n2 = int(input("second one = "))

#The program divides the two numbers and prints the remainder
remainder = n1 % n2
print(remainder)
